    plain:
      'Accounting rules sort a fund’s balance into five tiers by how tied-up the money is: Nonspendable (can’t be spent at all — inventory, prepaids), Restricted (locked by outside law or grant terms), Committed (set aside by the Board’s own formal action), Assigned (earmarked by intent), and Unassigned (genuinely flexible). Only that last tier is the true cushion. Town Law still uses the older phrase “unappropriated unreserved fund balance” — total assets minus liabilities, deferred revenues, encumbrances, amounts already appropriated into next year’s budget, and amounts reserved by law — which GASB 54 replaced in the financial statements themselves.',
    riverhead:
      'Riverhead’s 2025 General Fund balance was $33,407,251 in total — but $2,012,534 of it is nonspendable, $17,924 restricted, $42,435 committed, and $1,663,273 assigned. The actually-flexible unassigned balance is $29,671,084. Quoting the $33.4M total as “the cushion” overstates available money by about $3.7M.',
    ask: 'When someone cites a fund-balance number, ask which tiers it includes, how much is unassigned — and whether the Town has adopted a written fund-balance policy, which OSC recommends every local government adopt and review annually.',

Balancing a recurring cost with one-time money works this year and rebuilds the same hole next year — with growth on top. State law lets a town carry over a “reasonable amount” of fund balance and spend it mid-year, but only when actual and expected revenues plus that carryover genuinely exceed what the budget assumed.',
    riverhead:
      'Riverhead’s unassigned fund balance could erase the entire projected 2027 tax-cap gap on paper. It would also be spent, and the gap would return in 2028 — which is why the plan leans on recurring trims and the retirement incentive instead, and reserves one-time money for the residual.',

      'New York limits how much a town can raise its property-tax levy each year — the lesser of 2% or the rate of inflation, with adjustments for tax-base growth and certain exclusions. The Board can legally exceed it, but only by adopting an override local law first, in public, with a 60% vote of the governing body. The cap is a guardrail with a documented exit, not a hard ceiling. One step is easy to miss: the Town’s chief fiscal officer must file a tax-cap form with the State Comptroller *before* the budget is adopted, so the levy limit is on record with the State ahead of the vote.',
    riverhead:
      `Riverhead adopted overrides in 2023, 2024, and 2026, and on current trends the 2027 levy pierces the cap again by about ${capGapM}. The question worth asking isn’t only whether an override happens, but whether a cap-compliant version of the budget was ever shown alongside it.`,

The Board revises it into the preliminary budget, publishes notice at least five days ahead, and holds the public hearing on the Thursday following the general election — adjournable, but never past November 15. The budget must be adopted by November 20. The sharpest detail: if the Board fails to adopt by then, the preliminary budget simply *becomes* the budget by operation of law.

Each of these leaves a public paper trail in the minutes.',

If the two funds rest on different tax bases, the repayment must also include the interest the lending fund would have earned.
