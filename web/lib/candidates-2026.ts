// Cost–benefit analysis of the stated platforms in the November 3, 2026 Riverhead
// Town Supervisor race — the only Town seat on this ballot. This is a neutral,
// symmetric analysis of each candidate's OWN stated proposals: every plank gets
// a benefit, a cost, and a feasibility/tradeoff note, grounded in this app's
// budget data. It is not an endorsement, a prediction, or a claim about what a
// candidate "really" intends — only an estimate of what each stated proposal
// would take and what it would move.
//
// Platforms are transcribed from CandidateWatchData (iOS CandidateWatchView),
// which sourced them from each campaign's own website/social media plus local
// news coverage. Fiscal anchors (the cap gap, the retirement buyout, police OT,
// the $33.4M General Fund balance of which $29.7M is unassigned, the Peconic Bay
// CPF) are the same figures used elsewhere in the app.
//
// The cap gap is DERIVED from the projection rather than written in, so these
// planks can't drift from the number the rest of the site shows. It was
// hardcoded as "~$2.62M" against an older run of the model; the projection has
// since moved and the prose had not.

Here is how that is normally addressed, independent of who wins.',
